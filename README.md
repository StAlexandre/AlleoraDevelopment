# AlleoraDevelopment
***
This is intended to serve as the central hub for all the behind-the-scenes development of [Angel Steps'](https://twitter.com/angelstepsvr) Minecraft server.

Within the [Downloads](https://github.com/StAlexandre/AlleoraDevelopment/tree/main/Downloads), you'll find the current resource packs and data pack zip files. No need to unzip, just download and plug them into the proper folders!

As for the Test World download, you'll need to unzip it in your "saves" folder in order to use the test world to experience it yourself. The resource pack and datapack are already inside the world, though, so you won't need to download the other two to test it out!

Datapack should be put into the datapack folder, and if using the datapack, make sure to also download the resource pack labeled DPForm. The two need to be used in tandem for proper functionality.

If you plan on using just the resource pack, download the standalone form.

## Datapack changes:

* Adds a new recipe to the default game

* Playing the custom disc overrides the music from the jukebox and instead plays the audio file from the player's position
  * Datapack made using [Infinite Music Discs App](https://github.com/TeamTernate/infinite-music-discs)
  * It may be possible to instead replace the music coming from the jukebox, but the core code of the game would need to be investigated

## Resourcepack changes:
Original GodItems textures are kept.
* Patched issue with original GodItems pack where upgrading the Might of Thunder to netherite would result in the default netherite axe texture

* Created pack image

### Datapack form difference:
* A disc with a custom skin and audio is resulted from the crafting, default Disc 11 is still accessible
  * Audio created by [@AlmightyDupus](https://twitter.com/AlmightyDupus)
