# AlleoraDevelopment
***
This is intended to serve as the central hub for all the behind-the-scenes development of [Angel Steps'](https://twitter.com/angelstepsvr) Minecraft server.

Yes, it is barebones at the moment, but as it's built up, more files and descriptions will be added.

Within the [Downloads](https://github.com/StAlexandre/AlleoraDevelopment/tree/main/Downloads), you'll find the current resource packs and data pack zip files. No need to unzip, just download and plug them into the proper folders!

Datapack should be put into the datapack folder, and if using the datapack, make sure to also download the resource pack labeled DPForm. The two need to be used in tandem for proper functionality.

If you plan on using just the resource pack, download the standalone form.

Recipe:

Music Disc 11 + Book & Quill + Emerald
